# MiniMap
Our project intends to explore how access to a small map of teammates' locations could enhance the experience of many simple outside-games. Our app will set itself apart by offering built in game modes in addition to basic functions of a friend-finding map.
Project Objectives
    The project will aim to assist its users with navigation by enhancing common social games and tasks. To summarize, our objectives are as follows:
Implement an application that will allow friends to locate each other using GPS-based locations
Give users the ability to use a suite of game modes to assist in common social activities that include, but are not limited to:
Sardines
Capture the Flag
Marco Polo
Create an inviting graphical user interface that gives the user the impression that they have a minimap similar to what would be found in a video game
Use features of android such as step counting, accelerometer, and compass to make a more fluid and accurate tracking system
Implement an augmented reality interface for the friend finding subsystem of our application
